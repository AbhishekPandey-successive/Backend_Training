<!-- Create a file named 'different-architecture.md' and elucidate the distinctions among various architectural types, outlining their unique characteristics and differences from one another. -->


1.Monolithic Architecture:

In a monolithic architecture, the operating system kernel is designed to provide all operating system services, including memory management, process scheduling, device drivers, and file systems, in a single, large binary. This means that all code runs in kernel space, with no separation between kernel and user-level processes.


The main advantage of a monolithic architecture is that it can provide high performance, since system calls can be made directly to the kernel without the overhead of message passing between user-level processes. Additionally, the design is simpler, since all operating system services are provided by a single binary.


Characteristics of Monolithic Architecture:

1.Single Executable: The entire application is packaged and deployed as a single executable file. All components and modules are bundled together.

2.Tight Coupling: The components and modules within the application are highly interconnected and dependent on each other. Changes made to one component may require modifications in other parts of the application.

3.Shared Memory: All components within the application share the same memory space. They can directly access and modify shared data structures.

4.Monolithic Deployment: The entire application is deployed as a single unit. Updates or changes to the application require redeploying the entire monolith.

5.Centralized Control Flow: The control flow within the application is typically managed by a central module or a main function. The flow of execution moves sequentially from one component to another.




2.Microservices Architecture:

A microservices architecture takes this same approach and extends it to the loosely coupled services which can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. Each of these services is responsible for discrete task and can communicate with other services through simple APIs to solve a larger complex business problem.

As the constituent services are small, they can be built by one or more small teams from the beginning separated by service boundaries which make it easier to scale up the development effort if need be.

Another advantage which a microservices architecture brings to the table is making it easier to choose the technology stack (programming languages, databases, etc.) which is best suited for the required functionality (service) instead of being required to take a more standardized, one-size-fits-all approach.


First, multiple microservices per operating system can be deployed. With this model time is saved in automating certain things, for example, the host for each service does not have to be provisioned.

The downside of this approach is that it limits the ability to change and scale services independently. It also creates difficulty in managing dependencies. For instance, all the services on the same host will have to use same version of Java if they are written in Java. Further, these independent services can produce unwanted side effects for other running services which can be a very difficult problem to reproduce and solve.



3.Serverless Architecture:

Serverless architecture is a software design approach where developers can build and manage applications without managing the underlying architecture. Serverless applications still run on servers, but the cloud service provider is responsible for provisioning, managing, and scaling all the cloud infrastructure. 


Serverless architectures are designed to abstract servers and server management away from development teams. “Serverless” does not mean there are no servers; instead, the term refers to the overall development experience. 


From a developer’s perspective, you simply write the code and run it without worrying about anything else. All the provisioning, hardware maintenance, software and security updates to the servers, and other server management tasks fall to the cloud provider. In addition, serverless architectures automatically scale up or down according to traffic.


Benefits of serverless architecture:

Serverless solutions provide application development teams with several benefits over other types of infrastructure. Some of the main advantages of serverless architectures include the following: 

1.Automation:
Serverless solutions remove the toil of managing servers by automating tasks.

2.Scalability:
Serverless solutions scale up and down automatically in response to traffic without the need for fine-tuning or other manual configurations. 

3.Productivity:
Serverless computing empowers developers to focus on writing code and optimizing business logic rather than spending time on server management. Developers can also deploy their code directly into ad hoc testing environments as needed.
